Hello! My name is Reinaldo J. Mart√≠nez Morales. Although I was born in the town of Arecibo and I am a Captain at heart, I grew up in the Romantic City of Puerto Rico, Camuy. Currently, I am in my fifth year of the Computer Engineering program as an undergraduate student.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, especially pop and rock from the 1980s. I also like watching movies and series, but I particularly enjoy delving into extra material, such as behind-the-scenes footage, or the inspiration/events behind the movie or series. Another hobby I enjoy is reading, whether it's fantasy books, novels, or those based on historical events.
