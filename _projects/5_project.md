<H2>My personal definition of Intelligence:</H2>

In my opinion, intelligence is the human ability to apply knowledge and skills to solve complex problems. An intelligent person is someone who can understand practical and theoretical topics and apply them in any discipline of interest. Likewise, intelligence is what enables us to develop new ideas that go beyond what currently exists. I often compare intelligence to imagination because everything that has been created up to this day was imagined or thought of by someone before.
